# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: Conditional statement is when a condition is true then the piece of code we assign to it can run, and if its not true it wont run the code or it will run the code we assigned to it in case it is not true. 

Researched answer: A conditional statement is a decision making code based on certain conditions. Conditions can either be true or false. The code will run only if the condition is true. If not true another block of code can be executed.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software that tracks changes in a file where programmers develop code for a project. 
Github is a website for software development where developers can store their code and repositores. 

Researched answer: Git is a tool that is used for source code management. It is used to track changes to the source code and allows multiple developers to work on a development. 
Github is a cloudbased git repository that helps developers store, edit, track and control changes made to the main source code. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The logical operator since it can either be true or false. And booleans can only be true or false. 

Researched answer: In programming often you can only have 2 values, yes/no, true/false etc. The Boolean can be used to find out if an expression is true. So the logical operator will always return a boolean value.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: Index is the location of a value within an array or a string.
A value is a type of information that can be stored in variables. 

Researched answer: An index is a read-only property that contains the position of a value within a string. 
A value is a primitive data that can literally be written straight into the program.  

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: An iteration is the repetition of a code until we get a certain expected result. 

Researched answer: Iteration is a sequence of programming that takes the code and repeats it in a loop until a specific outcome is met. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming consist of a driver and a navigator. The driver is the person on the keyboard coding, and the navigator is the person telling the driver what to code.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a technique among software developers in which two programmers work together on one project. The driver writes code, while the navigator researches or reviews the code. THe roles are switched frequently. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
A higher order function is a function that treats a function as an argument or returns another function as an output.

2. Jest:
Jest is JavaScript testing library created by Facebook. It is designed for react based applications. 

3. Objects:
In JavaScript an object is a standalone entity that has properties and type. For example a phone is an object, it has a color, weight, brand,  etc. An object is the same in JavScript, it has properties that defines it.

4. Method:
 Method is the property of an object that contains a function definiton. Methods are functions stored as object properties.

5. Classes:
Classes are used to create objects. It can define what an object will consist of (instance property) and what it does (instance method).
